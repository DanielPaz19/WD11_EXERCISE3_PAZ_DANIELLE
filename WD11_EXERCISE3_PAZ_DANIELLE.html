          Tacloban, chartered city, northeastern Leyte, Philippines. It is
          located on San Pedro Bay at the southern entrance to San Juanico
          Strait.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tacloban is the largest city and distributing centre in the eastern
          Visayan Islands (Leyte and Samar) group. A port since 1874, it has a
          long deepwater wharf, a bulk petroleum depot, and an airport. Hemp,
          copra, and lumber are exported, and commercial fishing is important.
          The city is the seat of Divine Word University (1946) and the Leyte
          Institute of Technology (1966).
        </p>
        <p>
          Tacloban was an important Allied logistical base during the latter
          stages of World War II. On October 20, 1944, forces commanded by U.S.
          General Douglas MacArthur landed at several points along Leyte Gulf,
          south of the city, which they captured on October 21. Tacloban served
          as temporary capital of the Philippines until Manila was regained. Red
          Beach, to the south at Palo, was one of the landing sites and is now a
          tourist attraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tacloban was devastated by Super Typhoon Haiyan, a powerful tropical
          cyclone that struck the city on November 8, 2013. Thousands of people
          were killed, tens of thousands were left homeless, and buildings and
          transportation and communications infrastructure were largely
          destroyed by Haiyan’s violent winds and a large tsunami-like storm
          surge that swept through the city. Inc. city, 1952. Pop. (2000)
          178,639; (2010) 221,174.

          <p>
            The San Juanico Bridge (Filipino: Tulay ng San Juanico; Waray: Tulay
            han San Juanico) is part of the Pan-Philippine Highway and stretches
            from Samar to Leyte across the San Juanico Strait in the
            Philippines. Its longest length is a steel girder viaduct built on
            reinforced concrete piers, and its main span is of an arch-shaped
            truss design.

          <p>
            The MacArthur Leyte Landing Memorial National Park (also known as
            the Leyte Landing Memorial Park and MacArthur Park) is a protected
            area of the Philippines that commemorates the historic landing of
            General Douglas MacArthur in Leyte Gulf at the start of the campaign
            to recapture and liberate the Philippines from Japanese occupation
            on 20 October 1944. This event led to the largest naval battle of
            World War II (Also the world's largest naval battle in terms of
            gross tonnage sunk) and Japan's eventual defeat and surrender after
            almost three years. The war memorial is located in the municipality
            of Palo on Leyte island in Eastern Visayas and is one of the
            region's major tourist attractions. It was declared a national park
            on 12 July 1977 through Letter of Instructions No. 572 signed by
            President Ferdinand Marcos.

          <h2>Santo Niño Shrine & Romualdez Museum</h2>
          <p>
            The Santo Niño Shrine and Heritage Museum is one of the 20
            presidential rest houses built by late former President Ferdinand
            Marcos for his wife Imelda, who was originally from Tacloban. The
            luxurious structure served as a chapel, museum, and a guest house,
            with 21 bedrooms. In 1979, a religious landmark was built in honor
            of Sto. Niño, the patron saint of Tacloban City, then became under
            requisition of Presidential Commission on Good Government in 1986.
            For all its grandeur, however, it’s said that Imelda stayed in the
            house only once. Currently, it is widely visited by tourists for its
            affiliation with the Marcos family.
